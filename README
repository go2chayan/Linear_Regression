I did it as a part of homework problem in the Machine Learning class taught by Prof Daniel Gildea (https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~gildea/) in Spring 2014.

Homework: Implement linear regression for the voting dataset using Python. Split the 435 examples into 348 train / 45 dev / 42 test and report your classification accuracy on the test set.


************** Files ***************
README: This document
progAss1.py: The original python script. No functions defined. Just run the file using python

************* Algorithm ************
1. split dataset
2. w = pseudoinverse(X_train)*Y_train
3. Y_test = sign(X_test*w)
4. Check accuracy
5. repeat 100 times and calculate average accuracy

************* Results **************
Since the dataset was split by random sample, the 
average accuracy varies in each run. Typically it is
close to 0.89

************* Interpretations *****
None

************* References ************
I asked TA if it okay to randomly sample for
spliting the dataset into training and testing
set. He said it is okay.

I got an instruction from TA to ignore the 
Development set. So I didn't tune the parameter
Lamda. I just set it to zero.
